# MLOps – Concepts, Experiments and Practical Workflows

This repository contains practical experiments, prototypes and notes related to **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**.  
The goal of this project is to explore and implement workflows that bridge the gap between **machine learning model development** and **reliable, reproducible deployment**.

The repository is intended as a learning and experimentation space, focusing on how machine learning systems can be structured, versioned, trained, evaluated and maintained in a systematic way.

---

## Motivation

While many machine learning projects focus primarily on model training and evaluation, real-world applications require additional considerations such as:

- reproducibility of experiments  
- data and model versioning  
- automation of training and evaluation pipelines  
- monitoring and maintainability  
- clean separation between experimentation and production code  

This repository addresses these aspects by implementing small, focused examples that illustrate core MLOps principles.

## Scope and Topics

The work in this repository touches on the following topics:

- **Experiment tracking and reproducibility**
- **Data preprocessing pipelines**
- **Model training and evaluation workflows**
- **Configuration management**
- **Version control for code, data and models**
- **Automation concepts for ML pipelines**
- **Separation of research and production concerns**

Where appropriate, the implementations emphasize clarity and structure over premature optimization.

---

## Structure

The repository is organized into modular components, reflecting typical stages of an ML workflow:

- data handling and preprocessing  
- model definition and training  
- evaluation and analysis  
- experiment configuration and execution  

Each module is designed to be as self-contained as possible, making it easy to extend or adapt individual components.

---

## Technologies and Tools

The project primarily uses:

- **Python** for implementation
- Standard scientific libraries (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch / TensorFlow where applicable)
- Configuration-driven execution
- Version control via Git

Specific tools and dependencies are documented within the respective subdirectories.
